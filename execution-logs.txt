==================================================

Step 1: Initializing converter and reading configuration
  → Found package.json at: /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/package.json
  → Found node_modules at: /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/node_modules
  → Libraries found in package.json: clsx, scroll-into-view-if-needed, tabulator-tables
  → Libraries after filtering ignored: clsx, scroll-into-view-if-needed, tabulator-tables
Step 2: Bootstrapping TypeScript environment
  → Standard library configuration: es6
  → Bootstrap completed, found std as stdlib
  → Initial sources from bootstrap: clsx, scroll-into-view-if-needed, tabulator-tables
  → Converting clsx, scroll-into-view-if-needed, tabulator-tables to scalajs...
Step 3: Setting up TypeScript parsing phase
  → TypeScript parsing phase configured
Step 4: Setting up Scala.js conversion phase
  → Scala.js conversion phase configured
Step 5: Setting up flavour transformation phase
  → Flavour transformation phase configured: <function5>
Step 6: Creating conversion pipeline
  → Conversion pipeline created successfully
Step 7: Processing libraries through pipeline
  → Processing 3 libraries: clsx, scroll-into-view-if-needed, tabulator-tables
  → Processing library clsx
  → Result for clsx: Ok
  → Processing library scroll-into-view-if-needed
  → Result for scroll-into-view-if-needed: Ok
  → Processing library tabulator-tables
  → Result for tabulator-tables: Ok
  → Pipeline processing completed. Processed 3 libraries
  →   clsx -> Ok
  →   scroll-into-view-if-needed -> Ok
  →   tabulator-tables -> Ok
Step 8: Processing results and generating Scala files
  → Successfully processed 5 libraries
Step 9: Creating global scope for all libraries
  → Global scope created successfully
Step 10: Generating source files
Step 11: Writing files to disk
  → Writing tabulator-tables (142 files) to /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/generated-sources/tabulator-tables...
  → Writing clsx (2 files) to /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/generated-sources/clsx...
  → Writing minimized compute-scroll-into-view (2 files) to /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/generated-sources/compute-scroll-into-view...
  → Writing scroll-into-view-if-needed (2 files) to /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/generated-sources/scroll-into-view-if-needed...
  → Writing minimized std (102 files) to /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/generated-sources/std...
  → Successfully generated 250 Scala source files to /Users/tunguyen/Desktop/DELETEME/scalablytyped-scala3-rebuild/generated-sources
